## Project Questions

### 1. Which tools and technologies did you use for the project? Why?

In this project, I used PHP, Laravel, MySQL, and DialogFlow to meet the requirements of the API and the Bot.

### 2. Which were the main challenges in the process? How did you solve it?

I would say the main challenge was the configuration of the bot, as it is something that requires a lot of specificity, and due to some circumstances, I couldn’t dedicate as much time to it as I would have liked.

### 3. If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

I would put more focus on coding and DialogFlow from the start.

### 4. Did you learn anything new?

I mainly learned about things related to AI and bots, as I was able to work with and learn quite a lot from practical experience.

### 5. Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

No, I feel that with fewer setbacks during development, I could have delivered a much more complete, detailed, and efficient product, through which I could demonstrate my skills better.

### 6. Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?

My ability to develop and implement visually attractive interfaces, and my ability to contribute more to projects where I can showcase my skills.

## Bot Instructions

To ensure the bot works correctly, I would appreciate it if you use only words, as I configured it this way. Examples of words to use are "Hola," "Productos," "Categorias," as well as the name of each product and category.
